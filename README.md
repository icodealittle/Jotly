# About Jotly

## Introduction: About The Project

Reflect on how your mood changes overtime by adding a journal entry to it! 

** HOW DOES THE APP WORK** 

Pick any moods provided that best describe your emotion for that day. You can also write down your end-of-the-day activities and add them to your mood summary. You can also journal with daily new prompts without having to think much! The prompts are designed for you to reminisce about your past and present. At the same time, it also makes you feel about your future â€“ whether the mistakes you made, decisions you wish you had completed, goals, etc.

Jotly is here to help you care for your mental health and emotions! A good self-care strategy is key to improving your mood.
